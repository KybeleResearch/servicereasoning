Helpers

- containsAnnotation(value:String) : Boolean : return a boolean value if contains a annotations with the value
						is equals to the string passed as parameter.

- isFullfilledConditions() : Boolean : return a boolean value for indicate if all the conditions are fullfilled:
					  
    - element.Typing=SUB AND element.subset IS NOT 'off' equivalent in not pro.
    - element.Typing='N/A' AND element.subset='unset'.

Rules

 -Service2Service -> In the output model remains the element ServiceDescription of the Provider.

 - Operation2Operation -> mantains the elements operation that fullfilled the conditions independently of the source model.

 - Message2Message -> maintains the elements message that fullfilled the conditions independently of the source model.
 
 - InfoType2InfoType -> maintains the elements infotypes that fullfilled the conditions independently of the source model.

 - InfoTypeImported2InfoTypeImported -> maintains the elements infotypesImported that fullfilled the conditions independently of the source model.

 - Assertion2Assertion -> maintains the elements assertions that fullfilled the conditions independently of the source model.

 - AssertionsSet2AssertionSet -> maintains the elements assertionsSet that fullfilled the conditions independently of the source model.

 - Profile2Profile -> maintains the elements profile that fullfilled the conditions independently of the source model.

This transformation generate a output model with a list of elements that fulfilled the conditions. In the output model doesn't represent the relationships between the elements because they belong to both input models.
