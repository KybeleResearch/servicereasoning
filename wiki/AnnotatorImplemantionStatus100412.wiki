#summary Status of the implementation of the annotator on 10/04/12. The aim is at re-undertaking thw work done so far.

= Introduction =
The idea is that we first annotate the two versions of the service in order to have annotated versions of them to produce the contract.

 * ServiceAnnotation(V,,1,,, V,,2,,) ⇒ V,,1,,' = V,,1,, + Annotations
 * ServiceAnnotation(V,,2,,, V,,1,,) ⇒ V,,2,,' = V,,2,, + Annotations
 * ContractGeneration(V,,1,, + Annotations, V,,2,, + Annotations) ⇒ ServiceContract 

= Service Annotation =

Basically checks subtyping relationships annotating every element (X) from the source model of the transformation as follows:
  * If ∄​ (X ϵ S,,1,,, Y ϵ S,,2,,) / (X.name ≡ Y.name) ⇒ *N/A*
  * If ∃ (X ϵ S,,1,,, Y ϵ S,,2,,) / (X,,name,, ≡ Y,,name,,) ∧ (X,,isTypeOf,, ≡ Y,,isTypeOf,,) then
    * If X < Y then (if _X is subtype of Y_)
      * If Y < X ⇒ *EQUIV* (_X and Y are Equivalent_)
      * If Y ≮ X ⇒ *SUB* (_X is subtype of Y_)
    * If X > Y then (if _X is supertype of Y_)
      * If Y < X ⇒ *EQUIV* (_X and Y are Equivalent_)
      * If Y ≯ X ⇒ *SUPER* (_X is supertype of Y_)
  * If ∄​ (X ϵ S,,1,,, Y ϵ S,,2,,) / (X.name ≡ Y.name) ∧ (X.isTypeOf ≡ Y.isTypeOf) ⇒ *NONE*(_there is no matching element for X)
