#summary TODO list and discussion on contract generation, following the changes in the theoretical aspect.

*Contract Generation*

_Input_: ASD!Provider, ASD!Client (both annotated)

_Output_: ASD!Contract

----
 # Add to ASD!Contract every element in ASD!Provider, ASD!Client that (OR): 
  * element IN ASD!Provider AND element.Typing=SUB AND element.subset IS NOT 'off'
  * element IN ASD!Client AND element.Typing=SUB AND element.subset IS NOT 'off'
  * element.Typing='N/A' (see comment on the wiki) AND element.subset='unset' AND has NOT be added already
 # Connect the elements so that the result complies to the ASD meta-model - this may actually be a bit tricky.
 # Next steps to follow after verification of the theoretical part...
